                    <p>Since 1950, the <strong>global child mortality rate is going down</strong> and the numbers are predicted to go even lower in the later years.
                        We have come a long way since then, mainly due to efforts from <strong>skilled individuals; more accessible nutrition; increased knowledge and awareness; and
                        overall improvement of water, sanitation and hygiene</strong>. 
                        <br><br> 
                        However, there is still much to be done in regards to another kind of epidemic in child mortality, that is <strong>road-traffic accidents leading to fatal injuries.</strong>

                    <p id="fact">
                        In 2017, there was a total of <strong>49,068</strong> under 5 deaths by road-traffic accidents worldwide.<br>
